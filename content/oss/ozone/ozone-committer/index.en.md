## First of all‚Ä¶

Ozone is written in **Java**.
My own Java r√©sum√©? Basically just Prof. [Hsin-Chieh Lee](https://www.csie.ncku.edu.tw/zh-hant/members/3)‚Äôs class at NCKU, plus a tiny end-of-term project‚Äîa little stress-testing tool‚Äîbuilt with legends [Zhe-You Liu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhe-you-liu/) and [Henry Chang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/henrychang2026): [https://github.com/NCKU-CSIE-Union/Japybara-CLI](https://github.com/NCKU-CSIE-Union/Japybara-CLI).

I‚Äôm telling you this because **if I can jump into Ozone with *that* background, so can you!** üöÄ

## Self-intro

Hi, I‚Äôm **Peter Lee (ÊùéÁ∑íÊàê)**, a third-year CS undergrad at [NCKU](https://www.csie.ncku.edu.tw/en/).

*Obsessed with open source, distributed systems, and storage tech*‚Äîprobably a childhood trauma from using potato-grade PCs. My dream is to duct-tape a bunch of crummy machines into one awesome super-computer.

* GitHub: [https://github.com/peterxcli](https://github.com/peterxcli)
* LinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterxcli/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterxcli/)

Fun fact: before contributing, I had **never** touched Ozone in real life. I‚Äôd only spun up MinIO in Docker for kicks, and at my internship we use GCS. Ozone‚Äôs S3 compatibility? Zero connection. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Why Ozone?

### The spark

Early 2025 I stumbled across Ozone, skimmed the architecture blog posts, went ‚Äúhey this is cool,‚Äù and boom‚Äîcloned the repo, read the docs, started squashing Jira tickets. No ten-year master plan, just vibes.

### Why it‚Äôs cool

1. **Protocols galore**‚ÄîHTTP, S3, HDFS. Plays nice with everything.
2. Fixes HDFS‚Äôs scaling pain and loves small files.
3. Containers give SCM centralized placement control *without* killing performance‚Äîarguably higher availability than Ceph/MinIO.
4. Big names running Ozone: Tencent, LYC, Shopee, Preferred Networks. (Search GitHub‚Äîyou‚Äôll see more secret admirers.)
5. Jesse (Ozone PMC) says Shopee‚Äôs cluster holds **4 billion keys**‚Äî10√ó a maxed-out HDFS NameNode.
6. Didi‚Äôs engineers claim *tens* of billions of keys and *hundreds* of PB. Blog post coming soon.
7. Apache 2.0 license. Totally free. That alone is unbeatable.

![threads-post](ozone-rk3.png "https://www.threads.com/@jc.techtalk/post/DFqWz69SarA")

## What I got out of it

### Tech chops

* Compare architectures of Ceph, MinIO, DeepSeek 3FS, etc.‚Äîsee each one‚Äôs trade-offs.
* Ozone feels micro-service-ish: each component with clear boundaries. Eye-opening design study.
* Lots of RocksDB deep dives‚Äîcompaction, iterators, checkpoints, key I/O bottlenecks.

### Perspective

* **Collaborate with engineers way above my pay grade.** Their knowledge just floods in like a typhoon.
* Real users show up in Jira/Slack long before a shiny blog post appears on LinkedIn.

### Communication

* Most discussion happens on design docs, PRs, Jira‚Äîasync, different time zones. Say things *once* and make them crystal. (I‚Äôm still learning. If you have resources, hit me up!)

## Some numbers

### PRs & Reviews

* \~**50 merged PRs** ‚Üí [https://github.com/apache/ozone/pulls?q=is\:pr+is\:merged+author\:peterxcli](https://github.com/apache/ozone/pulls?q=is:pr+is:merged+author:peterxcli)
* \~**40 reviews** (excluding my own) ‚Üí [https://github.com/apache/ozone/pulls?q=is\:pr+is\:open+reviewed-by\:peterxcli+-author\:peterxcli](https://github.com/apache/ozone/pulls?q=is:pr+is:open+reviewed-by:peterxcli+-author:peterxcli)
* Currently **#46** on Ozone GitHub contributor leaderboard.

![github-contribution-peterxcli](github-contribution-rk.png)

### Third-party stats

1. **OSS Rank**
   ![oss rank](ossrank.png)
   I‚Äôm #11‚Ä¶ plus another me at #60 because the site duped my account. üß¨
   ![oss rank peterxcli at rk60](ossrank-peter-rk60.png)

2. **OSS Insight**
   Often swings into the top-2 for activity. Forgot to screenshot the pinnacle though.
   ![oss insight](ossinsight.png)

None of this matters‚Äîjust dopamine for self-care.

## I got the Apache Ozone **Committer** badge!

Huge thanks to Jesse for shouting it out on his socials‚Äîprofessors reposted it, Taiwanese tech morale soared, and I had literally *just* binge-watched all five seasons of Breaking Bad the night before. Perfect timing.

## My Apache Ozone journey

### Early days ‚Üí ‚Äúmid-game‚Äù

#### 1 . Refactoring tests

* **Include AWS request ID in S3G audit logs** [#7725](https://github.com/apache/ozone/pull/7725)
* **Add tests for `SnapshotChainRepair`** [#7741](https://github.com/apache/ozone/pull/7741)
* **Create endpoint builders for S3G tests** [#7753](https://github.com/apache/ozone/pull/7753)

#### 2 . Pagination for **`listMultipartUploads`** in S3G & OM

Main PR: [#7817](https://github.com/apache/ozone/pull/7817)

Follow-ups that popped up while I was knee-deep in the code:

| Follow-up                                                                                                                                        | What it fixes / improves                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sort multipart uploads on response** <br> [#7929](https://github.com/apache/ozone/pull/7929)               | Switched to **UUID v7** (time-based) for upload IDs so OM no longer has to sort in memory; also matches the S3 spec‚Äôs ‚Äútime-based ordering‚Äù requirement. |
| **Duplicated key scanning on `multipartInfo` table** <br> [#7937](https://github.com/apache/ozone/pull/7937) |

#### 3 . **ReplicationManager** turbo-charge [#7997](https://github.com/apache/ozone/pull/7997)
`ReplicationManager` (inside SCM) tracks container replicas across DataNodes. The patch lets it detect DataNode state changes *much* faster, cutting reaction latency from **minutes to seconds**.

#### 4 . SCM Safemode refactors

| Area                                     | PR                                                                                     | What changed                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **EC vs. Ratis containers**              | [#7951](https://github.com/apache/ozone/pull/7951) | Split the one-size-fits-all rule into **two** rules, because EC and Ratis have different replica-count logic.                    |
| **DataNode safemode**                    | [#7998](https://github.com/apache/ozone/pull/7998) | Instead of keeping its own copy of node status, the rule now asks **`NodeManager`** directly‚Äîsingle source of truth, fewer bugs. |
| **Pipeline availability check property** | [#8095](https://github.com/apache/ozone/pull/8095) | Deleted an obsolete `hdds.scm.safemode.pipeline-availability.check` flag.                                                        |

#### 5 . CI speed-ups (with [Attila](https://github.com/adoroszlai))

Maven no longer compiles every module for flaky-test checks‚Äîonly the modules that matter.

### Recent & current work

#### 1 . DataNode improvements

DataNode is the Ozone component that physically stores every container‚Äôs files.\
Because it deals with disk space directly, even tiny mis-calculations can snowball into outages‚Äîespecially when multiple threads are creating or importing containers at the same time.

> Import container?\
> That‚Äôs the act of pulling a fully-formed container from another DataNode (usually during recovery or data-rebalancing) and ‚Äúinstalling‚Äù it locally. It happens in parallel with regular container creation, which means two different code paths might race to grab the same disk space.
>
If ten threads each try to put a 10 GB container onto a volume that only has 11 GB free, and they all check ‚Äúhey, space looks fine!‚Äù before actually reserving it, you end up ‚Äúallocating‚Äù 100 GB into thin air. Oops.

![atomic-choose-volume-chart](atomic-choose-volume-chart-1.png)
![atomic-choose-volume-chart](atomic-choose-volume-chart-2.png)

#### 2 . Snapshot work

* **Limit the number of snapshots per bucket** [#8157](https://github.com/apache/ozone/pull/8157)

  Ozone snapshots piggy-back on RocksDB checkpoints (hard-links). ext4 caps hard-links at \~65 000, so OM now enforces a snapshot limit at the application layer. Looked trivial, turned into a 70-comment marathon thanks to OM‚Äôs double-buffer concurrency corner cases.

#### 3 . OM RocksDB compaction

* **Aggressive DB Compaction with Minimal Degradation** [#8178](https://github.com/apache/ozone/pull/8178)

  **Problem:** tombstones pile up; iterator scans die a slow death.
  **Idea:** slice the key space by *volume*, *bucket*, *folder* prefixes, keep per-range tombstone stats, and compact *small* ranges whose tombstone ratio blows past a threshold‚Äîso you whittle tombstones away in the background *without* nuking the whole table during peak traffic.

  Related community efforts worth noting:

  | **Online repair command: manual compaction** [#7957](https://github.com/apache/ozone/pull/7957) | Admin tool to compact a table asynchronously.  |

#### 4 . Miscellaneous

* **EventExecutorMetrics** instead of hacky reflection-based tweaks [#8371](https://github.com/apache/ozone/pull/8371)

  Those ugly `InaccessibleObjectException` warnings in test logs? Gone. Re-implemented the metric renaming trick safely‚Äîlog output is squeaky clean now.

  ![event-queue-metrics](event-queue-metrics.png)


## So I‚Äôm a Committer‚Ä¶ now what?

* **Reality check:** Committer ‚â† omniscient. I probably grok 15 % of the codebase. Haven‚Äôt even mastered the DataNode read/write path‚Äîlike a chef who can‚Äôt turn on the stove.
* **More reviews & design discussions**‚Äîcontainer reconciliation, snapshot scaling, S3 lifecycle‚Ä¶ I need to keep up.
* **Big-impact features** someday. Still a long grind ahead.
